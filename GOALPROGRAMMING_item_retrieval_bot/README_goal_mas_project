The following is a Multi-Agent System asssignment in which Kornpol Chung was tasked with programming Java as well as in Perl to develop a BW4T (Block Worlds For Teams) agent.
BW4T was developed by TUDelft as an extension to GOAL for embodied agents in environmentsm, the assignment in question is meant to represent a search and rescue bot
which has been tasked with collecting blocks (representing people) of different colors. The agent is capable of traversing the entire environment and collecting and
placing the blocks in a pre-determined color-order. 

The assignment showcases the ability to utilize modules for a disembodied agent in Java, as well as Perl dynamic programming. 

To run the assignment; 


1. Start a new Project in Eclipse (or a compatible IDE) 

2. select the Goal perspective (Window → Perspec- tive → Open Perspective → Other → GOAL).

3. Run the bw4t-server-3.9.3.jar file in which a GUI will pop-up 

4. Run the bw4t.mas2g file as GOAL 


The bot will begin completing the aforementioned task.
