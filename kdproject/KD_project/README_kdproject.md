The Knowledge and Data project was created as a final assignment for Kornpol Chung's Knowledge and Data course. The project covers being able to extract data 
ontologies online as well as locally and displaying them in a comprehensive and pleasant web interface. The Web Interface itself covers the use of Javascript 
frameworks to illustrate the databases as well as other Javascript code to enhance the readability and interactibility of the web interface. Use of HTML and CSS 
in this project is minimal but sufficient for the project. 

To run the project, import the index.html file and run it through Google Chrome or Safari.
